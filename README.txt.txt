/!\ Subject /!\

The students will work on the Mini-Lab robot (more information here : https://enovarobotics.eu/product/),  its control architecture is open-source and is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS).
Firstly, they will need to understand the main code of ROS and how to connect the robot to the computer using its hardware.
Secondly, they will have to program an algorithm which will be use by the Mini-Lab to perform obstacle avoidance.
